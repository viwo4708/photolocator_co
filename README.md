# HackCU8 2022

My partner Heather Monteson and I created this proof of concept in 24 hours, and we won first place in UI/UX. Not too shabby for a first Hackathon!
We used HTML/CSS/Javascript and Bootstrap to create the site. 

As a photographer myself, one of biggest struggles starting out was trying to find new places to shoot. We wanted to create a crowdsourced, browsable database of photoshoot locations for photographers to browse. When you click on an image, it brings up a Google Maps popup that shows the location the photo was taken at. In the future, I want to implement a backend, as well as searchable image tags.
